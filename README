Welcome!  I made this Bot after a joke that was started in LinkHeroOfTwitch's Twitch chat.  We decided that
speedrunners needed a coach that would "encourage" them to do better.  Thus CoachBot was born.

Using CoachBot is pretty simple:

1) If you are running this on Windows then you need to install python 2.7 (Macs already have it by default) Download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
(I'm not sure if this works with python 3, but it probably does) 

2) The zip file for CoachBot contains a few files:
CoachBot.py - This is the actual bot program
Config.py - This is where the stream name goes
Various text files that contain the things CoachBot can say

3) In Config.py there is a line that looks like:
CHANNEL = "streamname"

Replace streamname (but keep the quotes) with whatever your streamname is.

There is also:
ANTIKAPPA = “no”

If you want CoachBot to scold people when they use Kappa then set this to yes.

4) Double click on CoachBot.py and a command prompt will open and hang out there if the bot started correctly.  In your chat you will see that CoachBot has announced itself.

5) Enjoy

CoachBot commands:
!coach - give encouragement to the runner
!romance - give romance advice
!congrats - give praise to the runner when he/she/it does well

Add sentences, words, sad faces, whatever into the files associated with each command to expand CoachBots repertoire:
- Coach_Responses.txt
- Romance.txt
- Congrats.txt

People in your chat can add new phrases also by using:
!addcoach
!addromance
!addcongrats


If you have any questions or issues, feel free to send me a message on Twitch.
